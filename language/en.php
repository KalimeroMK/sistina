Healthy kidneys work by filtering your blood to create about 1500-2000 ml of urine every day. Besides the “removal” or “cleaning” job, kidneys have several other very important functions! 
On a daily basis, your kidneys work to:<br>
 - Release hormones to help regulate blood pressure<br>
 - Control sodium and fluid levels in your body<br>
 - Stimulate production of red blood cells, which carry oxygen throughout the body<br>
 - Create vitamin D to help your body absorb calcium");

The sooner your doctor can confirm a diagnosis for CKD, the earlier you can get started on a treatment plan that may help preserve kidney function and slow progression of damage. Put yourself first and don’t put off testing if you’re in an at-risk population.

                                    <p class=\"content-p sml\">One of the trickier aspects of chronic kidney disease (CKD) detection is that <strong>the signs and symptoms of kidney disease occur late</strong>, after the condition has progressed. In fact, CKD is sometimes known as a “silent” condition because it’s hard to detect—and most people with early stage CKD are completely unaware of it.<br>
Talk to your doctor immediately if you notice any of these signs and symptoms of kidney disease:<br>
- <strong>Changes in urination</strong> including foamy or bloody urine, more or less urine than usual or getting up more at night to urinate<br>
- <strong>Fatigue </strong> lack of usual energy or feeling overwhelmingly tired<br>
 - <strong>Itching</strong> waste buildup in your blood can cause severe itching<br>
- <strong>Swelling in hands or feet</strong> swelling can occur when kidneys aren’t removing extra fluid over time Shortness of breath—extra fluid not removed by kidneys can build up in your lungs; breathlessness can also be caused by anemia<br>
- <strong> Pain in the small of your back</strong> localized pain near your kidneys that doesn’t change or becomes worse when you move or stretch
<p>Other potential symptoms of kidney disease</p>
- <strong> High blood pressure</strong><br>
- <strong> Poor appetite or nausea and vomiting</strong><br>
- <strong> Puffiness around your eyes, especially in the morning </strong><br>

- <strong> If you have any of the signs or symptoms of kidney disease, talk to your doctor and get tested.</strong>
